##Project Highlights

The highlights for this project were learning how to capture the users selection and using that stored variable to change the filter of News Stories.  The other highlight would be using a loop and counter to limit the number of stories that are displayed when the user selects their news catagory.

##Lessons Learned

The biggest take away from this project is the process of interacting with an API through Ajax.  Learning this process was very exciting for me and something that will be very useful in the future.
